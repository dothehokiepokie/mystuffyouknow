about the crypto program i mean to integrate the sarcasm program to validate only crypto words that share a common letter, or some logic  like that to make the crypto harder to break.

what the crypto program does;

probably making a list or array that sends in a value in some loop, and only one value is true for a short amount of time.

i imagine if you made a value memory address cryptographically hidden, 
you could cycle the cryptograph 

for some time part of the list that holds the word is true, then the list is erased, and then a different or same part of the list is true for the word for some time.

and also made the cryptograph itself hidden by having a additional barrier like 
my sarcasm programs that finds shared letters in mutliple words doing the same for crypto words the crypto program makes,
the shared letters validating multiple crypto keys.
